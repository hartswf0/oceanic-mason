# Oceanic Mason

A collection of digital meditation tools that explore the principles of non-extractive computation and ontological rebellion. Each experience creates a space for reflection on the nature of digital sovereignty and the hidden depths of computational reality.

## About Ocean Nobode

The Ocean Nobode collection represents a series of digital meditation tools with deep ocean aesthetics, featuring subtle wave movements, thread interactions, and haunting soundscapes that evoke the mysterious qualities of the deep sea.

These looms have been refined to create authentic textile-like experiences with:
- Subtle wave movements and natural energy transfers
- Deep, rich color palettes
- Rotating philosophical quotes about digital sovereignty
- Film grain textures and authentic textile/loom appearances

## Philosophical Framework

The Ocean Nobode system operates within a framework that recognizes:
- Software as ontological violence
- Computation as extractive spacetime manipulation
- True sovereignty requiring non-Turing models
- Creative tools must become anti-tools that erase their corporate origins

By engaging with these experiences, we invite reflection on how digital technologies shape our understanding of reality and how we might reclaim sovereignty in digital spaces.
